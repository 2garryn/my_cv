>  Erlang is my main and favorite programming language, because everything in this world is a process and Erlang follows this approach rightly. But generally it doesn't matter which language you use in your team, because the key of success is to be sure everybody's on the same page and to follow the right processes.

Technical Experience
--------------------

### Programming languages

* **Erlang** - developing applications, troubleshooting and correction existing code. Most of my code is written in Erlang. In different projects in my carrer I learned and used **Riak** and **Mnesia** as databases. **Riak Search** as search framework over **Riak**. **Riak-Core** for distributed job execution. **Mochiweb** and **cowboy** as web-servers. Improved **poolboy** as worker pool.

* **JavaScript** - ES5 and ES6 standards. Implementation of logic parts for mobile client based on **Cordova**. Used technologies: **React**, **React-Router**, **Flux**, **Flummox**. **NPM** was used as dependencies control system and **Webpack** as bundle creator.

* **Python** - used only for pet-project that is not released yet. It has JSONRPC2 HTTP API. I use **gevent** to parallize JSONRPC2 batch request, **flask** as web-server to provide HTTP JSONRPC2 interface and **sqlalchemy** as ORM over **MySQL**.

* **SQL** - MySQL dialect. I didn't use it on regular basis, because previous projects tried to avoid SQL databases usage in favor of **Riak**.

* **Shell** - writing simple scripts, **Bash**, **C-shell**. But I prefer to write shell scripts using **Python**. 

* **C++ with Qt** - small project in start of my carrer.

* Readiness to learn and improve my skills in technologies like Python, Erlang, Elixir, Go.


### Tools & Protocols

Linux, emacs, Adobe Framemaker, ClearCase, git, REST, Pubsubhubbub, exmpp, rebar, SNMP, TCP/IP family, JSONRPC2.

  * Erlang client for twitter streaming API (http://dev.twitter.com/pages/streaming_api)
  Code was not released, because it was in beta stage when I left project.
  * Erlang client for real-time content releaser http://superfeedr.com/.
  Code was not released, because it was in beta stage when I left project.

* **[Alogger](https://github.com/siberian-fast-food/alogger)** - abstract logger framework for Erlang in scope of [Spawnfest](http://spawnfest.com).
I wrote "parse_transform" part.
 
* **[URL shortener in Erlang](https://github.com/2garryn/esli)** - Please note, that it was created on start of my carrer:)

* **[Nasoc](https://github.com/2garryn/nasoc)** - SOCKS5 in Erlang with statistic saved to Riak.

* Tool that helps to create algorithm for woodworking machine. Qt and C++
